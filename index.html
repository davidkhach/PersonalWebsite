      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p>Hi! I am David Khachatryan, a junior undergraduate student studying
        computer science at the University of California, Irvine. In high school
        I started learning programming on my own and decided to continue
        pursuing my interests by majoring in computer science at UCI. I was an undergraduate
        tutor this past year tutoring students taking C++ and Python courses.
        <br>
        <br>
        At UCI, our programming courses mainly focus on creating small projects in
        Python and C++. My goal is to expand this knowledge and learn different frameworks
        and technologies to be able to create projects that solve interesting problems. Currently,
        I am focusing on learning front-end development with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am
        looking to expand my programming knowledge with an internship which would allow me
        to experience working in the real world with a team of talented developers.
