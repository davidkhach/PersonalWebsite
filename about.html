        <p>Hi! I am David Khachatryan, a junior undergraduate student studying
          computer science at the University of California, Irvine. In high school
          I started learning programming on my own and decided to continue
          pursuing my interests by majoring in computer science at UCI. I was an undergraduate
          tutor this past year tutoring students taking C++ and Python courses.
          <br>
          <br>
          At UCI, our programming courses mainly focus on creating small projects in
          Python and C++. My goal is to expand this knowledge and learn different frameworks
          and technologies to be able to create projects that solve interesting problems. Currently,
          I am focusing on learning front-end development with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am
          looking to expand my programming knowledge with an internship which would allow me
          to experience working in the real world with a team of talented developers.
        </p>
